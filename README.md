## Background

Bullet is a streaming query engine that can be plugged into any singular data stream using a Stream Processing framework like Apache [Storm](https://storm.apache.org), [Spark](https://spark.apache.org) or [Flink](https://flink.apache.org). It lets you run queries on this data stream - including hard queries like Count Distincts, Top K etc. The main project is available **[here](https://github.com/bullet-db/bullet-core)**.

## Install

Bullet Pulsar is a Java implementation of the Bullet [PubSub](https://bullet-db.github.io/pubsub/architecture/), published to [Bintray](https://bintray.com/yahoo/maven/bullet-pulsar) and mirrored to [JCenter](http://jcenter.bintray.com/com/yahoo/bullet/bullet-pulsar/).  To see the various versions and set up your project for your package manager (Maven, Gradle etc), [see here](https://bullet-db.github.io/releases/#bullet-pulsar).
